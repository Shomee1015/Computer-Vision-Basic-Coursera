About this Course
By the end of this course, learners will understand what computer vision is, 
as well as its mission of making computers see and interpret the world as humans do, by learning core concepts of the field 
and receiving an introduction to human vision capabilities. They are equipped to identify some key application areas of 
computer vision and understand the digital imaging process. The course covers crucial elements that enable computer vision:
digital signal processing, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Topics include color, light and image formation; early, 
mid- and high-level vision; and mathematics essential for computer vision. Learners will be able to apply mathematical 
techniques to complete computer vision tasks. 

This course is ideal for anyone curious about or interested in exploring the concepts of computer vision. 
It is also useful for those who desire a refresher course in mathematical concepts of computer vision. Learners should have 
basic programming skills and experience (understanding of for loops, if/else statements), specifically in MATLAB 
(Mathworks provides the basics here: https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html). Learners should 
also be familiar with the following: basic linear algebra (matrix vector operations and notation), 3D co-ordinate systems 
and transformations, basic calculus (derivatives and integration) and basic probability (random variables).
